# Emotion-Detection-CNN

## Introduction

This project is designed to automatically detect human emotions from facial images using deep learning techniques. A custom CNN architecture is utilized, specifically optimized for emotion recognition. The main objective of this project is to provide an accurate and efficient model for classifying emotions based on facial expressions.

## Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for feature extraction and emotion classification from facial images.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes steps to prepare images, such as resizing and enhancing image quality, to improve model accuracy.
- **Custom Dataset**: The model is trained using a labeled dataset of facial images.

## Model

- A custom CNN architecture is implemented for emotion detection in this project.
